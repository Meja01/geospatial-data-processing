Collaborated in a team at the university to develop a geospatial data processing application,
gaining a solid understanding of Spring Boot and client-server communication. Contributed to
server-side development, focusing on data parsing and management using Spring Boot, which
underpinned the projectâ€™s core functionality. Actively participated in designing and implement-
ing communication protocols to handle geospatial data, enhancing my knowledge of data seri-
alization and RPC mechanisms. The project provided a hands-on experience with the basics of
geospatial data processing, demonstrating the practical application of theoretical concepts in a
real-world-like scenario.
